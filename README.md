# Quest Interface
This repo contains the games that have been updated and are continuously being updated based on specifications.

## How to Run
For each game, you will have to build them and then set them up to the ULRobotSoftware Streamlit application

### Building
#### Catch
Under the Unity Build Settings tab, make sure you select FallingTargets as your scene and NOT Sample Scene! Then, build it to a Build folder or whatever name you like to call it.

#### Flappy Build
Under the Unity Build tab, build the Sample Scene into a folder called Build or whichever name you prefer.

### Running
After building, move the folder to the `unity_builds` section of the ULRobotSoftware Streamlit repo and make sure to double check that the bash scripts are properly linked to the corresponding folder.
